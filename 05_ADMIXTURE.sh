# Script for using ADMIXTURE to determine ancestry from genomewide SNP data

# Modified 4.20.19 to run with bootstrap

# Input files should be in binary plink (bed/bim/fam) or .ped/.map plink and merged for the sample and reference panels
# Usage: ./04_ADMIXTURE.sh  $1=merged_dataset_basename

# Unsupervised analysis with bootstrap and using 4 threads.
# Run ADMIXTURE for K 2-10 with the crossvalidation parameter activated such
# that we can see the CV errors. The ideal K is the one with the lowest cv errors.
# The tee command is for taking the standard output and writing it to a file.
